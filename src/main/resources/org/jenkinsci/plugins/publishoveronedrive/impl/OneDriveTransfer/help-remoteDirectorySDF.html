    <p>Select this to include the timestamp in the remote directory.</p>

    <p>The timestamp is the date of build. If this publisher is being used during a promotion, then the timestamp is
        that of the build that is being promoted.
        <br/>This setting turns the remote directory option into a java SimpleDateFormat.
        <br/>The SimpleDateFormat(SDF) uses letters to represent components of the date, like the month, year, or day of
        the week. <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html">Click here for
            more information about the date patterns.</a>
        <br/>As the SDF reserves all of the letters [A-Z][a-z], any that you want to appear literally in the directory
        that is created will need to be quoted.</p>

    <p>Some examples follow - all examples are based on a build with a timestamp of 3:45 pm and 55 seconds on the 7th
        November 2010.
