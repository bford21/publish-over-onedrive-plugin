    <p>Files to upload to a server.</p>

    <p>The string is a comma separated list of includes for an Ant fileset eg. '**/*.jar'
        (see <a href="http://ant.apache.org/manual/dirtasks.html#patterns">Patterns</a> in the Ant manual).<br/>
        The base directory for this fileset is the artifacts directory of the build that is being promoted. Ensure that
        you
        "Archive the artifacts" in the Post-build Actions to make your artifacts available during a promotion<br/>
        Change the base directory to the workspace by setting the "Use the workspace" checkbox.
