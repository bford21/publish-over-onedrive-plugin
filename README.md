# Publish over Dropbox plugin for Jenkins

Based on publish-to-ftp and extending publish-to and basic-credentials this Jenkins plugin publishes artifacts in a post-build to dropbox folders without the need to run a sync client on your build server.

# Installation

There are 3 options:

1. ~~Install the plugin through the Jenkins plugin manager.~~ (Not available at this time)
2. Install a beta
   1. Download the latest build is available at:   https://github.com/rcgroot/jenkins-publish-over-dropbox-plugin/releases/tag/1.0-rc2
   2. Install the pre-build publish-over-dropbox-rc2.hpi in the advanced section of the Jenkins plugin manager on an existing Jenkins install.
3. Compile your own
  1. Create an own Dropbox app in the on https://developer.dropbox.com/
  2. Clone the sources and update the Config.java with your personal client id and client secret.
  3. Run the "mvn hpi:hpi" on the project source code
  4. Install the generated publish-over-dropbox.hpi on the advanced section of the plugin manager of your Jenkins installation.
# Configuration

To publish artifacts to a Dropbox there are three levels of configuration. Each level is dependent on the previous. 

### Link an account

The highest level is connecting a Dropbox account to Jenkins. Dropbox account connections can be created in the **Jenkins > Credentials**.

### Create a location

The second level is to create a location for a previously linked account. Locations can be created in **Jenkins > Manage Jenkins > Configure System**.

### Publish files

The last level is to actual publish files to a Dropbox location. Publishing can be done as **Post-build Actions** in your build job configuration.
